# boilerplate

javascript boilerplate.

## Build

- [x] editorconfig
- [x] instal package.json
- [x] update gitignore
- [x] install express for dev server.
- [x] share work with coworkers
- [] npm automation (work on more.)
- [x] upgrade to babel-node so I can take advantage of es6 javascript.
- [ ] build some gulp scripts (later)
